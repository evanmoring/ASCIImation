# ASCIImation

This will animate text files as ASCII art on the webpage. Instructions:

*Create a folder for your ASCII text files in the same location as the provided HTML and JS files
*Each frame of ASCII art should have its own text file
*Make sure the ASCII filenames are formatted "000.txt"

*I set up the Javascript file so you can easily modify parameters
*the 'step' parameter allows you to skip some frames in your folder. '1' would use every frame, '5' would only use every five frames
*the 'start' parameter lets you start at a frame other than the first frame. If you want the animation to start at the first frame provided, use '0'
*the 'end' parameter' lets you end on a frame other than the last frame. If you want the animation to end at the last frame provided set this parameter to the last frame. 
*IE if the last frame is '099.txt' set end to '99'.
*set 'animationFolder' to the folder with your ASCII frames
*set 'msBetweenFrames' to the delay between frame changes in milliseconds. For example '100' would be 1 change / 100 ms or 10 fps

I included a .tar file of example animation frames for testing.
